Deep learning using tensorflow

Deep learning is applied to the problem of predicting the health of commercial building HVAC systems, the data set in the <a href="https://github.com/LilyHu/data_wrangling_buildingdatafd">data_wrangling_buildingdatafd</a> responsitory. 

The performance of a convulutional neural network trained using only the original data is compared against the performance of a convulutional neural network trained using application knowledge.
